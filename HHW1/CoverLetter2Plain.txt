This letter is in regards to my interest in applying for the position recently posted on your website\'92s careers section. During my studies at R.I.T, I have had the opportunity to strengthen my skills in programming, specially in JAVA and C++. I am open to learning new things in programming and software development prior to my internship to gain the necessary skills. In the classroom I have committed myself to academic excellence which can be reflected by my grades. In my Undergraduate term I have worked with HTML5 and CSS on front end. I have had good exposure in team based work environments as I had served as Creative Head for my colleges\'92 Student Council in undergraduate years, where I supervised the design of logos material for different college festivals, at the same time working as a part of bigger team. This has helped connect me to students of different backgrounds and function as an comprehensive group.
